    <p div id="e"> My name is Mark Luoma. I am a born-and-raised native from Geneva, OH and I'm crazy about Cleveland.
                My journey that's led me to where I am today has been an adventurous one and I'm excited to be in 
                this course learning a whole new language. As a college graduate from the University of Mount Union,
                my biology degree has led me to various worksites in various cities such as Tampa, FL and Gulf Shores, AL.

                Aside from my education and work history, I am a nature enthusiast who enjoys all things outside.
                During the (short) warmer months in Ohio you can find me on a golf course dropping eagles or,
                you can find me fishing on the lake or hiking in the woods. During the (long) winter months I can 
                be found snowboarding in NY or binge watching 'The Office' for the 100th time. I'm a down-to-earth 
                guy who enjoys nothing more than a day outside topped with a craft brew and some Barrio tacos.
